     * The art of routing is comparative to its own state of functioning.
     * There is a surrogate connection. It quietly chooses the direct path.
     * It does also create the inside walls of a copacetic network. One which
     * is offset from a larger web. These internal gadgets are what we get
     * from holding connections in their surrogate form. We are berthing
     * the state of an annal concluding to the cache. Here and therein, we
     * setup a great choosing from the forms of loadtimes, concurrency, threading
     * and other essential states of meta in the system. To break it down,
     * we need to make a network that consists of many channels. And it needs
     * to have administrative, group, and user identifying characteristics.
     * So we'll see what we can come up with here in this PASM coded router.
     * What don't you think I'll come upon?
