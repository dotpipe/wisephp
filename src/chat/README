In order to properly use this you will need to know how to deal with databases
The script uses a database with enough power to keep all messages private.
If you want to change it at all, in order to create more security, and you have
the skill, ou could add encryption. How to, I'm not going to get into.

File: \Adoms\config\chat.ini
    This file is used to hold a JSON of the first five parameters of mysqli_connect
    If you've just installed and you haven't deleted anything, you can consider
    the file almost completely on its own, except that it needs a database listed,
    it needs the correct user (default: root) and the password defaulted to and
    empty string.

Set these COOKIES accordingly, possibly in users HOME directory:
    'myemail'   : The user's username, likely their email. This is without doubt
                probably the most important attribute
    'chatfile'  : This is another cookie attribute to get the nod in the app.
                This should fill in by itself. It does when you use the chat.js
                file.
    'chatalias' : the final cookie to get in to the chat app is to hold onto your
                username's 'alias' in chat. This should be setup somewhere in your
                own application's setup.

Chat is a strong commodity in web apps. If you wish to really get your customers
to live at your site, you'll need at least communications technology existent on
your site.

Database Setup:
    Table Name: chat
    Columns (In order):
        'id'        : the id no. of the entry
        'start'     : chat proposal began by this user's username
        'aim'       : target chatter of 'start'
        'filename'  : hashed filename of entry
        'last'      : last message
        'altered'   : last time comment was altered
        'checked'   : file has been seen after update
        'conduct_on': allow cursing on/off
    Table Name: conduct
    Columns (In order):
        'serial_id' : entry number
        'chat_id'   : chat id from Table 'chat'
        'conduct_on': Whether or not conduct was turned off or on
        'message'   : flagged message contents
        'date'      : date and time of flagging
        'flagged'   : did user flag the comment
        'username'  : flagged user

XML Specs : Your xml files should resemble these entries

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='chatxml.xsl' ?>
<messages>
    <msg alias="David &lt;-&gt; Dave">
        <text time="1567391831" user="inland14@live.com" alias="David">ksjdk</text>
    </msg>
    <msg alias="Dave &lt;-&gt; David">
        <text time="1570152298" user="tcp@null.net" alias="Dave">ajdf</text>

    <msg alias="Dave &lt;-&gt; David">
