# Adoms
PHP Library and MVC


To use the chat aspect, just include:

Adoms\src\chat\outchat.php

I seriously realize that the page index.php is ugly. Seriously realize that. But there are no style templates in Adoms. I just did that early in the promotion of the product to ensure that there would be some kind screenshot of everything working. Everything that you would need to test, as of classes, is seen in in the index.php. Again, horrible mess, Ugly to no definition. Thanks for cloning!!
